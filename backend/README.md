# ManageRestaurantOrder

## Project Description

ManageRestaurantOrder is a backend-only REST API designed to manage orders in a fast food restaurant system.

The project follows a layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability. It provides a structured backend capable of handling order processing, business logic, and persistent data storage.

The objective is to deliver a clean and extensible backend system suitable for real-world food service management scenarios.

### Architectural Principles

- Functional approach (no object-oriented programming)
- Strict separation of concerns
- No SQL queries outside repositories
- No business logic inside controllers
- Centralized error handling
- RESTful API design

---

## Tech Stack

- Node.js – JavaScript runtime for server-side execution
- Express.js – Web framework for REST API development
- MySQL – Relational database management system
- mysql2 – MySQL client with Promise support
- Nodemon – Development server auto-reload tool
- OpenAPI / Swagger – API documentation interface

---


## Requirements
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm
- MySQL server

### Node.js Version
---
It is recommended to use a stable LTS version:

`node -v`

Minimum: Node.js 16+

## API Documentation

If Swagger is enabled, access the API documentation at:

http://localhost:3000/api-docs

---

## Database

The project uses MySQL as the relational database system.

Ensure:

- MySQL is installed and running
- The database defined in .env exists
- Required tables are created before starting the server
